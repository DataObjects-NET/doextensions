How to build DataObjects.Net Extensions
=======================================
DataObjects.Net Extensions are built using MSBuild tool from .NET Framework 4.0 or later.
At the root of repository you can find MSBuild project All.proj.
This project builds binaries as well as distribution packages.
Also it is capable of fetching required DataObjects.Net version from its download site.

***Important*** 

You can't build the DataObjects.Net Extensions in Visual Studio first time because DataObjects.Net
needs to be downloaded. MSBuild project All.proj will handle this. After first 
build with MSBuild all prerequisites are installed and you can use Visual Studio to build 
and test the extensions. You must create a SQLEXPRESS database named 'Tests' to run unit tests.

To build project you need to open "Visual Studio Command Prompt" otherwise you'll have to enter
full path to MSBuild.exe. NuGet.exe (NuGet package manager command line tool) must be available
in %PATH% as well. NuGet.exe isn't installed with the NuGet Package Manager but must be installed 
separately and put in the %PATH% manually.

All.proj have multiple targets to control build process:

  * GetDO - fetches DataObjects.Net of required version

  * BuildBinaries - builds all projects
  * CleanBinaries - cleans all artifacts that are produced by BuildBinaries target
  
  * BuildPackages - builds NuGet packages for DataObjects.Net Extensions
  * CleanPackages - cleans all packages that are produced by BuildPackages target
  
  * BuildZip - builds .zip archive with DataObjects.Net extensions binaries
  * CleanZip - cleans .zip archive that is produced by BuildZip target
  
  * Build - combines BuildBinaries, BuildPackages and BuildZip (This is default target)
  * Clean - combines CleanBinaries, CleanPackages and CleanZip
  * Rebuild - invokes Clean target and then Build target
  
By default all projects are build using Release configuration.
Also only release configuration is allowed when NuGet or .zip packages are to be built.
To change configuration to debug you should add /p:Configuration=Debug to your MSBuild parameters.

Since All.proj is the only MSBuild project in its directory. You can omit project file name
from MSBuild parameters. MSBuild is capable of detecting which project to use automatically.

Building examples
=================
How to build everything from sources?

    > msbuild

How to build binaries only?

    > msbuild /t:BuildBinaries

How to build binaries only?

    > msbuild /t:BuildBinaries /p:Configuration=Debug

Since BuildPackages and BuildZip targets are automatically disabled for non-Release builds
previous command could be simplified to

    > msbuild /p:Configuration=Debug

How to clean all artifacts?

    > msbuild /t:Clean

How to fetch required version of DataObjects.Net?

    > msbuild /t:GetDO

How to develop DataObjects.Net Extensions
=========================================
You can develop DataObjects.Net extensions using either Visual Studio 2010 or recent SharpDevelop.
Before opening project make sure you have fetched all required packages. This is have to be done
everytime any package requires upgrading. When all packages are up to date you can open
Extensions.sln from Sources folder and start developing.

How to change version for all projects
======================================
Open Version.props in text editor. At the top of the file you'll see version variable declaration.
It should look like the following:

    <PropertyGroup>
      <Version>4.5.1</Version>
      <VersionModifier>RC</VersionModifier>
      <DOVersion>4.5.3</DOVersion>
    </PropertyGroup>

Change the version to required. Rebuild everything using corresponding command from first section
of this document.

How to find build artifacts
===========================
All build artifacts are located inside _Build folder. Inside it there are many subfolders.

    _Build\
        Binaries\       - DataObjects.Net extensions binaries and test suite binaries
            Debug\      - Debug binaries
            Release\    - Release binaries
        Packages\       - NuGet packages for DataObjects.Net Extensions
        Zip\            - .zip distribution archives
